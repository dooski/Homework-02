DAN MCKEON PORTFOLIO

1. PLAN: The website will serve as a personal portfolio for me and my various works. The website should be able to answer basic questions clients, recruiters or colleagues may have as well as provide contact info and links to completed projects in the past. For accessibility and readability, the website should reformat depending on the size of the screen it is displayed on and the type of device.

2. CURRENT STATUS: The website in it's current state has an About Me page with a brief bio written in the third-person and a placeholder for a professional headshot. The portfolio page currently has no projects to list, but is set up with column spaces and placeholder photo blocks to be updated as more projects are created. The contact page is set up with a form for sender's email address, a subject, and a message. The index.css file currently is only used to provide some padding to the main content on pages.
